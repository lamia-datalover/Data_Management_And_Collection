# The goal of this project :
The goal of this mini project is to become acquainted with web scraping, an essential skill in data engineering. As data can be extracted from various sources such as websites and documents, it's crucial to understand this process. The objective here is to retrieve the title of a T-shirt sold on Amazon daily and save it to a CSV file. To achieve this, the code should be modified to sleep for 86400 seconds instead of 1 second between scrapes. This approach can be beneficial for monitoring variables that change over time, such as the price of an item, particularly during events like Black Friday or for tracking the price of airplane tickets.

In this project, BeautifulSoup and requests libraries were employed to extract the desired data from the Amazon website. Subsequently, the retrieved data was cleaned, and a date variable was added to indicate when the data was obtained. Finally, a CSV file was created to store the data, with each scrape occurring once per second. However, to scrape data daily, the sleep interval should be adjusted as mentioned earlier.
